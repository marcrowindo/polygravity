          <p>At its core, Polygravity is a high performance, high security double-entry book keeping system. It records and notarizes transactions between two parties, and puts transaction data into the record file of each party where it becomes immutable. Everything can be transacted, be that conventional fiat currency, cryptocurrency, data, rights to physical assets, etc. as long as it is traded against another value (e.g. usage of a telecomunications network against fiat currency).</p>

          <p>Polygravity's transaction system consists of three different protocols that come together to create the perfect digital transaction:</p>

This ensures that the applications which communicate remain unidentifiable to potential eavesdroppers. In addition, transmission layer based authentication allows for identification of communicating parties to each other exclusively, further reducing feasibility of DDoS attacks.</p>

                      <p>According to data protection laws, customers have the right to have their data deleted. Due to perpetual record storage attributes of classic bockchain systems this produces friction between blockchain-based systems and privacy laws.<br>Polygravity solves this problem by allowing transacting parties to “forget” about blocks after an individually configurable time period. However, much like in a double-entry bookkeeping system, every transacting party holds an immutable and fully notarized record of every transaction it made with other system participants. As a result, even if a trading party would delete their complete transaction history, other parties could still prove what transactions have been made between them and the party who deleted their records.</p>

                        <p>Polygravity's EADP validates transactions locally between two transacting parties. As a result the system exhibits a <em>runtime complexity of O(1)</em> meaning that there is no loss in system efficiency when new parties join the network. In other words: Every joining node ads to the global amount of transactions that can be processed in the system.<br> In contrast, classic blockchain-based networks come with <em>global</em> consensus algorithms that validate transactions <em>globally</em>, in the entire system, which means that there is a <em>global limit</em> to their transaction throughput. In other words: Every joining node reduces the average transaction throughput capability of each node (ceteris paribus) and the global transaction throughput limit remains constant.</p>

However, localy between two transacting parties, transaction packet throughput is dependent on hardware processing capacity.<br><br>Initial load tests on an outdated 2009 2.93 GHz i7 870 processor with 4 cores yielded 12’000 transaction- packets per second with a transaction-packet size of 512 bytes of random data per transaction.<br>However, the transaction processing algorithm is perfectly parallel, such that doubling the computational resources will double the transaction throughput (ceteris paribus). Otherwise put: Faster hardware will deliver more transactions per second in a linear fashion, meaning that a modern midrange performance server CPU, like many AMD EPYC CPUs, with 16 cores instead of 4 would deliver a <b>transaction-packet throughput of 48’000 per second</b>. Assuming that cores did not become any faster in the past 9 years.</p>

                        <p>All parties in the network are able to create HACs in order to ensure maximum data availability and security of their system. One HAC consists of multiple nodes (current maximum at 12) that synchronize via private blockchains and together act as a single party (accountant or client).<br>By bringing together 3 nodes or more in one party, byzantine failure tolerance is achieved, meaning that one third of all nodes can be overtaken by enemies who act maliciously without the system being disturbed. If more than 3 nodes are brought together only a third + 1 nodes must be operational, a third of all nodes can be overtaken by enemies, and the remaining nodes can be down without the system experiencing any disturbances.<br>Because private ledgers are stored with the accountants, high availability clusters are usually less interesting to clients.</p>

                <h3>Use case example</h3>
                <h4>A simplified telecom network billing scenario</h4>

                      The below example illustrates the workings of the combination of <b>PSDP</b>, <b>ESDP</b> and <b>EADP</b> in a scenario where a telecom operator uses Polygravity's system in order to bill their customer for network usage.<br><br>
                      Billing is executed based on unalterable billing data which was notarized by both parties. Billing transactions occur in real-time and are settled by both parties’ accountants and transaction data is stored immutably on the accountants’ hardware. <br>
                      The scalability of Polygravity’s system allows every network user, be that IoT sensors, phones, etc. to be billed separately in real-time without reaching any transaction throughput ceilings.
